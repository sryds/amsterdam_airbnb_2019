Airbnb Amsterdam 2019

This project selects and analyzes certain variables from sets of data taken from Airbnb listings for Amsterdam as of December 6, 2018. The data includes information on the location, price, type of accommodation and availability of each listing for each day of the upcoming year (up to 6 December, 2019). It also includes information from reviews of each listing, such as ratings assigned by guests for a variety of factors (location, value, cleanliness). 
Through the exploratory analysis of this information, this project aims to answer questions such as which neighbourhoods are the most popular among guests, which neighbourhoods have the most and least number of vacancies on average in the upcoming year, where visitors can find the best value for their money and what factors are most important to visitors when choosing a place to stay in Amsterdam.
Please note that while the raw data contains personally-identifying information about Airbnb hosts, none of this information was used in this project.
